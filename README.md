# About this project
This project contains sample scripts and tips for setting up a Windows development machine.

These scripts leverage two popular projects
- Boxstarter [boxstarter.org](http://boxstarter.org)
- Chocolatey [chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org)

This project exists because we noticed scripts and tips showing up in different open source projects and thought it would be useful to have a central place for collaborating on setup scripts.

The goal here is to provide a central place to share ideas for streamlining dev box setup and give you starting point ideas. It's likely you will want to take scripts here and modify them to fit your particular needs.  When you make those changes if you think others would benefit please consider submitting a PR here.  Before you contribute please see the contribution guidelines.

## Script naming convention
The "dev_" scripts are named according to developer scenario.

## How to run the scripts
Links will be provided here in the readme<br/>
Click the link and you'll see a prompt for boxstarter click once.  CLick yes and the system setup will begin!

An example to try is click this should work for the dev_web script:<br/>
