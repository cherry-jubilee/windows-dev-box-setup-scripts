# About this project
The goal of this porject is to provide a central place to share ideas for streamlining dev box setup and give you starting point ideas. It's likely you will want to take scripts here and modify them to fit your particular needs.  When you make those changes if you think others would benefit please consider submitting a PR. Before you contribute please see the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

These scripts leverage two popular open source projects.
- Boxstarter [boxstarter.org](http://boxstarter.org)
- Chocolatey [chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org)

## How to run the scripts
Before you begin, please read the [Read Before You Run](#read-this-before-you-run) section.  

To run a script click a link in the table below. This will download Boxstarter, and prompt you for Boxstarter to run with Administrator privileges (which it needs to do its job). Clicking yes in this dialog will cause the script to begin. You can then leave the job unattended and come back when it's finished.

## Working with Chocolatey for Organizations?
No problem, you can still use these scripts. You'll need to modify the script to reference your internal package store.  Here are instructions for doing so:
